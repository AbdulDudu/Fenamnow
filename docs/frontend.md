# Frontend

This is the documentation of the frontend part of the project.

As stated in the introduction document, the UI for the web is built using NextJs with TailwindCSS for styling.

As for the Mobile version, it is built using Expo and React Native and the component library being used is
[Gluestack](https://gluestack.io/) which ships with it's own styling system.
